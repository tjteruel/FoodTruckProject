## Food Truck Project

### Overview

This is a Food Truck Application. It allows the user to create up to five food trucks by entering the truck name, type of food, and a numerical rating. The user can create less than five trucks by typing "QUIT" as the food truck name. The application then will bring up a menu with four options. From here the user can choose to display all the trucks that have been created, see the highest rated food truck, see the average ratings from all the food trucks, or quit the application.

### Lessons Learned

I learned about the different types of loops and how to use each one in various situations. I also learned that taking breaks are an important part of the working process. After struggling for over an hour to figure out why my truck ID numbers were not increasing properly, I took a 20 minute break. When I returned I immediately saw that in my FoodTruck.java I wrote the wrong variable in the print line.
